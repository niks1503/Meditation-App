## How It Works

- **Relax & Breathe**: Clicking on the ‚ÄúBegin‚Äù button triggers an animation showing a timer with a smooth transition. Users can follow along with the timer for relaxation.
- **Scene**: Clicking any of the GIF thumbnails will display the GIF in fullscreen mode with an overlay background. A close button (`X`) allows users to exit the fullscreen view.

- **Talk to Hope**: The page includes a list of possible greetings, commands, and questions. Users can interact by clicking on these, and the app responds with positive quotes or simple answers. Additionally, it offers a ‚Äúmic‚Äù button to speak out loud and listen to positive quotes.
